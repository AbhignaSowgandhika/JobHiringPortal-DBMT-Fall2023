# <a name="_khu82qlpyqzn"></a>**Proposal**
In the ever-thriving employment industry, it is always necessary to keep developing efficient and user-friendly job hiring platforms. Our primary goal is to create a comprehensive web-based Job Hiring Platform, aimed at reducing the gap between job seekers and employers. The platform will enable seamless job searches, streamline the application process, and allow employers to manage their hiring needs effectively.

Our database will cater to three primary user roles: Job Seeker (individuals seeking employment opportunities), Employer (companies and organisations posting job listings), and Administrator (includes those who oversee and manage the entire platform). The platform will utilise a robust technology stack: the front end includes PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, or Angular and the database is created using Oracle.

We also put sufficient focus on creating an intuitive and user-friendly UI for all stakeholders by following a comprehensive set of steps including business requirements, logical ER diagrams, relational diagrams, and database creation. The database and the website have been interlinked to achieve smooth data entry and retrieval operations.

This project aims to revolutionise the job hiring process by providing a centralised, efficient, and secure platform for its target consumers. Through careful design and implementation, our Job Hiring Platform will contribute to the creation of a robust ecosystem that facilitates meaningful connections in the job market.
